          <h4>PRICES AND PAYMENTS</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>How much does it cost to work with you?</li>
            <p>The cost of my services varies depending of the needs of each project. Having a website designed is depends on a lot of different factors.
            I have all the information required I will be more than happy to provide you with an estimate.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>How is the cost of your services determined?</li>
            <p>I quote my services as a fixed bid project. The cost structure is based on the services selected, the complexity of functionality and the size of the project.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>What form of payments do you accept?</li>
            <p>For most projects, I request a 50% down payment to schedule the work. I accept payment via PayPal. The final 50% will be paid on completion of the project.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Why do I need to send a down payment for the project?</li>
            <p>Shortly, to ensure that from the beginning the client has the same level of commitment to the project that I have.</p>
            <p>A down payment lessens the absolute risk either party takes. Without a down payment I, as a designer, have to take on 100% of the financial risk in the project. Down payment takes some of my risk and places it on the client, but ovarall it’s fair to both parties.</p>
            <p>When down payment is set, I can allocate the necessary amount of time for your project, turning down other projects if needed.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>What is your refund policy?</li>
            <p>If I’ve already started working on your project after receiving the down payment and you decide to hit the abort button, then I will not refund your down payment.</p>
            <p>As a disclaimer, I want to say that I’ve always completed my projects and I work with you until you are completely satisfied with the final result.</p>
          </ul>

            <h4>WORK AND SERVICES</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Can we still work together if we live in different countries?</li>
            <p>Absolutely! In fact the vast majority of my clients are based abroad. Project correspondence is simply conducted via email or direct messages as needed. This has never affected any of my projects.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>What services do you offer?</li>
            <p>I’ve specialized in web design, graphic design, and video editing. The work I create helps my clients move closer to their goals. The aim is to boost client profits thought improved attraction and retention of ideal customer bases.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>What is your work process?</li>
            <p>Process varies depending on the service. For example, developing a website requires testing and search engine optimization among other major tasks.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>How long will the project take to complete?</li>
            <p>This depends on the exact needs and deliverables of the project, but timeframes vary from one week to two weeks.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>I'm just starting a new business, can you help me?</li>
            <p>Of course. I love to work with start-ups and entrepreneurs, an empty canvas is always the best possible way to start an awesome project for your business.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>I get confused with domain, hosting, etc. Can you help me setup my site?</li>
            <p>Yes. I can acquire the domain in need for you and provide high-quality hosting. Ideally, I’ll take care of everything from the brief to the launch of your website.</p>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Can you maintain my website after the work is finished?</li>
            <p>Yes. Any time you need changes made to your website, big or small, simply let me know and I’ll give you an estimate of the work. No down payments, yay!</p>
            <p>If your site needs constant care for a longer time period, then a fixed monthly fee is a better choice for both parties.</p>
